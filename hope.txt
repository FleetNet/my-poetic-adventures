		Hope

How does the butterfly remains with courage,
that it can stay safe inside a cocoon?
Where does the ant get its courage,
that it will get its food to survive through monsoon?
What gives the plant its courage,
that a strong wind won't blow it away when it grows tall?
Why does a human hold on to courage,
that someone,somewhere is doing their duty,
so that they will stay safe in the middle of a crisis?
Because every being in the universe is connected to their future
through a feeling called hope.

-Vignesh.
